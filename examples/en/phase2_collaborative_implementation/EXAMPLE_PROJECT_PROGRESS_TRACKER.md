## Current / Next Tasks

*   Finalize error tests for `PaymentService`.
*   Increase unit and integration test coverage.
*   Start writing End-to-End tests with Cypress.
*   Update technical documentation with implementation details.
*   Refine Kubernetes deployment configurations.

## Risks and Blockers

*   **Risk:** Potential delay on End-to-End tests due to flow complexity.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize critical scenarios, consider progressive automation.
*   **Blocker:** No major blockers identified at the moment.
