# EXAMPLE: Project Implementation Log

This document is a logbook of project implementation activities, technical decisions made, and challenges encountered. It is updated collaboratively with the AI Developer Agent.

## Week 1: Initialization and Environment Setup

*   **Date:** 2025-06-10
*   **Activities:**
    *   Development environment configuration (Python, Node.js, Docker).
    *   Git repository initialization and branch configuration.
    *   API Gateway setup with FastAPI.
    *   Definition of initial data models for `OrderService` and `ProductService`.
*   **Technical Decisions:**
    *   Use of Poetry for Python dependency management.
    *   Choice of Pydantic for data model validation.
*   **Challenges / Notes:**
    *   Compatibility issues with a specific Docker Desktop version, resolved by an update.
    *   Need to clarify validation schemas for incoming API Gateway requests.

## Week 2: Order Service Development (OrderService)

*   **Date:** 2025-06-17
*   **Activities:**
    *   Implementation of CRUD endpoints for orders.
    *   Integration with PostgreSQL for data persistence.
    *   Setup of `OrderCreatedEvent` event publishing to Kafka.
*   **Technical Decisions:**
    *   Use of SQLAlchemy ORM for database access.
    *   Implementation of a Repository pattern to decouple business logic from persistence.
*   **Challenges / Notes:**
    *   Difficulty configuring Kafka locally for unit tests, temporary solution with a mock.
    *   Optimization of SQL queries to avoid N+1 issues.

## Week 3: Product Service Development (ProductService) and Frontend Integration

*   **Date:** 2025-06-24
*   **Activities:**
    *   Implementation of CRUD endpoints for products.
    *   Integration with PostgreSQL.
    *   Development of the React component for product display.
    *   Consumption of the `ProductService` API from the frontend.
*   **Technical Decisions:**
    *   Use of React Query for client-side asynchronous data management.
    *   Setup of Storybook for isolated UI component development.
*   **Challenges / Notes:**
    *   CORS issues between frontend and backend, resolved by API Gateway configuration.
    *   Complexity of shopping cart state management, exploring Redux Toolkit.

## Week 4: Payment Service Implementation (PaymentService) and Testing

*   **Date:** 2025-07-01
*   **Activities:**
    *   Implementation of payment processing logic (integration with a simulated payment gateway).
    *   Publishing of `PaymentProcessedEvent` and `PaymentFailedEvent` events.
    *   Writing unit and integration tests for all services.
    *   Setup of Cypress for end-to-end tests.
*   **Technical Decisions:**
    *   Use of Pytest for Python tests.
    *   Adoption of Jest for JavaScript/React tests.
*   **Challenges / Notes:**
    *   Management of distributed transactions between `OrderService` and `PaymentService` (Saga pattern considered).
    *   Test coverage to be improved for error scenarios.

## Week 5: Refinement and Deployment Preparation

*   **Date:** 2025-07-08
*   **Activities:**
    *   Performance optimization of queries.
    *   Improved error handling and logging.
    *   Preparation of Dockerfiles and Kubernetes configurations.
    *   Writing internal technical documentation.
*   **Technical Decisions:**
    *   Implementation of a circuit breaker for inter-service calls.
    *   Use of Black and ESLint for code formatting and linting.
*   **Challenges / Notes:**
    *   Finalization of monitoring configurations with Prometheus and Grafana.
    *   Code security review.
