# EXAMPLE: Master Requirements Specification

This document is an example of a master requirements specification, co-created with the AI Architect Agent. It serves as the single source of truth for the project, defining what the system must accomplish, for whom, and under what conditions.

## 1. Introduction & Strategic Project Vision

*   **Business Context:** The project aims to revolutionize task management for software development teams by integrating AI capabilities to optimize project planning, execution, and tracking.
*   **Core Problem:** Teams face difficulties maintaining a clear vision of requirements, anticipating risks, and ensuring fluid communication between design and implementation phases.
*   **Unique Value Proposition:** Offer an AI-augmented collaborative platform that ensures holistic planning, transparent execution, and continuous adaptability.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Reduced delivery times, improved software quality, increased satisfaction for teams and end-users.

## 2. Product Objectives

*   **Objective 1:** Improve specification clarity by 30% within six months, measured by a reduction in ambiguities identified during design reviews.
*   **Objective 2:** Reduce planning phase time by 20% through AI assistance.
*   **Objective 3:** Increase user satisfaction regarding the relevance of AI recommendations by 15%.

## 3. Precise Definition of Scope and Non-Scope

*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Management of functional and non-functional requirements.
    *   Architectural and data modeling.
    *   UI/UX specification.
    *   Implementation and unit test tracking.
*   **Out-of-Scope:**
    *   Advanced Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
    *   Cloud infrastructure management (beyond conceptual specifications).
    *   Multi-language support for the user interface (for V1).

## 4. Stakeholder and Persona Identification

*   **Solo Developer / Project Manager:** Seeks to optimize productivity, reduce planning mental load, and ensure the quality of deliverables.
*   **Software Architect:** Needs tools to formalize robust and scalable architectures and to communicate decisions effectively.
*   **UI/UX Designer:** Wishes to translate visual concepts into precise specifications and collaborate on user experience.

## 5. Detailed and Structured Functional Requirements Catalog

### F-CONTENT-REC-001: Personalized Content Recommendations

*   **Objective:** Increase viewing time per session and promote the discovery of new content.
*   **Priority:** High (MoSCoW: Must Have)
*   **Actors:** User, Recommendation System.
*   **Trigger:** User login, platform navigation.
*   **Preconditions:** User must have sufficient viewing history.
*   **Normal Flow:**
    1.  User logs in.
    2.  System analyzes viewing history, ratings, and preferences.
    3.  System generates a list of personalized recommendations.
    4.  Recommendations are displayed on the homepage and in a dedicated section.
*   **Alternative Flows:**
    *   If history is insufficient, suggest popular or trending content.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   If the recommendation service is unavailable, display "Recommendations currently unavailable" message and offer category navigation.
*   **Input Data:** Viewing history (Content ID, Duration, Date), Ratings (Content ID, Score), User Profile (Preferences).
*   **Output Data:** List of recommended content (Content ID, Title, Thumbnail, Short Description, Relevance Score).
*   **Business Rules:**
    *   Already viewed content is not recommended unless marked as "watch again."
    *   Recommendations must be updated every 24 hours.
*   **SMART Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   10% increase in click-through rate on recommended content within 3 months of deployment.
    *   Recommendation generation time less than 500ms for 95% of requests.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*   **Performance:**
    *   Critical API response time less than 200ms for 90% of requests.
    *   Platform must support 1000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
*   **Security:**
    *   User authentication via OAuth2/OIDC.
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
    *   GDPR compliance for personal data management.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   Ability to handle a 50% increase in user traffic within 6 months without major refactoring.
    *   Microservices architecture allowing independent scaling of components.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   Documented codebase adhering to coding standards.
    *   Unit and integration tests covering at least 80% of critical code.
*   **Availability:**
    *   Service availability of 99.9% (excluding planned maintenance).
*   **Evolvability:**
    *   Ease of adding new features without impacting existing ones.
    *   Support for new data sources for recommendations.

## 7. Constraints and Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**
    *   Development budget limited to X USD.
    *   V1 delivery deadline set at Y months.
    *   Preference for open-source technologies.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Users are familiar with video streaming platforms.
    *   Viewing history data is reliable and complete.

## 8. Glossary of Terms

*   **Persona:** Fictional and generalized representation of target users.
*   **NFR:** Non-Functional Requirement.
*   **MoSCoW:** Prioritization method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
