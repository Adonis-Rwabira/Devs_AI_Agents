# EXAMPLE: Senior Architecture Design

This document is an example of architectural design, co-created with the AI Architect Agent. It serves as a blueprint for the project's technical implementation.

## 1. Introduction and Strategic Objectives

*   **Objective:** Define a robust, scalable, and secure architecture for the AI-augmented task management platform, aligned with functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Guiding Principles:** Modularity, loose coupling, high cohesion, testability, security by design.

## 2. Architecture Overview

*   **Architectural Style:** Hexagonal Microservices (Ports & Adapters) on a Kubernetes platform with an Istio Service Mesh.
    *   **Justification:** This style promotes independent deployment, horizontal scalability, resilience, and ease of maintenance, while allowing clear isolation of business domains. The hexagonal approach ensures a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure details.

## 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Architectural Style Choice (Microservices)

*   **Problem Context:** The project requires high scalability, fault tolerance, and the ability to integrate new features quickly without impacting the entire system.
*   **Options Considered:** Monolith, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Microservices.
*   **Decision Made:** Microservices.
*   **Detailed Justification:** Microservices offer the best granularity for independent component scaling, increased resilience (a failure in one service does not affect others), and technological flexibility. Although operational complexity is higher, the long-term benefits for a project of this scale are superior.
*   **Consequences:** Requires a deployment and orchestration infrastructure (Kubernetes), inter-service communication management (Event Bus, API Gateway), and a distributed monitoring strategy.
*   **Status:** Approved.

## 4. Component/Service/Module Decomposition

### OrderService

*   **Role:** Manage the lifecycle of orders.
*   **Responsibilities:** Creation, update, cancellation of orders; order status management.
*   **Exposed APIs:**
    *   `POST /orders`: Create a new order.
    *   `GET /orders/{id}`: Retrieve order details.
    *   `PUT /orders/{id}/status`: Update order status.
*   **Produced Events:** `OrderCreatedEvent`, `OrderUpdatedEvent`, `OrderCancelledEvent`.
*   **Dependencies:** `PaymentService` (synchronous), `Event Bus` (asynchronous).

### ProductService

*   **Role:** Manage the product catalog.
*   **Responsibilities:** Creation, update, deletion of products; stock management.
*   **Exposed APIs:**
    *   `GET /products/{id}`: Retrieve product details.
    *   `PUT /products/{id}/stock`: Update product stock.
*   **Produced Events:** `ProductUpdatedEvent`, `StockReservedEvent`.
*   **Dependencies:** No direct dependencies with other business services.

### PaymentService

*   **Role:** Manage payment transactions.
*   **Responsibilities:** Payment processing, refund management.
*   **Exposed APIs:**
    *   `POST /payments`: Process a payment.
*   **Produced Events:** `PaymentProcessedEvent`, `PaymentFailedEvent`.
*   **Dependencies:** External payment gateway.

## 5. Key Architecture Diagrams

### Component Diagram (PlantUML)

```plantuml
@startuml
package "E-Commerce Order System" {
  component [API Gateway] as GW
  queue "Event Bus (e.g., Kafka)" as EventBus

  component [ProductService] {
    portin ProductApiIn
    portout ProductEventsOut
  }
  ProductEventsOut -u-> EventBus

  component [OrderService] {
    portin OrderApiIn
    portout OrderEventsOut
    portin PaymentEventsIn
    portin InventoryEventsIn
  }
  OrderApiIn <-u- GW
  OrderEventsOut -u-> EventBus
  EventBus -u-> PaymentEventsIn
  EventBus -u-> InventoryEventsIn

  component [PaymentService] {
    portin PaymentApiIn
    portin OrderEventsIn_Payment
    portout PaymentEventsOut
  }
  EventBus -u-> OrderEventsIn_Payment
  PaymentEventsOut -u-> EventBus

  database "Orders DB" as OrderDB
  database "Products DB" as ProductDB
  database "Payments DB" as PaymentDB

  OrderService .u.> OrderDB
  ProductService .u.> ProductDB
  PaymentService .u.> PaymentDB
}
@enduml
```
*   **Explanation:** This diagram illustrates the main microservices (`OrderService`, `ProductService`, `PaymentService`), the API Gateway, and the Event Bus as an asynchronous communication mechanism. It also shows the databases associated with each service.

### Sequence Diagram (PlantUML): Order Creation Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
actor "Client" as User
participant "API Gateway" as GW
participant "OrderService" as OS
participant "PaymentService" as PS
queue "Event Bus" as EB
participant "InventoryService" as IS
participant "NotificationService" as NS

User -> GW : POST /api/orders (New Order)
GW -> OS : createOrder(orderDetails)
activate OS
OS -> PS : processPayment(paymentDetails)
activate PS
PS -->> OS : paymentConfirmation
deactivate PS
OS -> EB : publish(OrderCreatedEvent)
OS -->> GW : orderPendingConfirmation
deactivate OS
GW -->> User : Order In Progress

EB -> IS : consume(OrderCreatedEvent)
activate IS
IS -> IS : reserveStock(items)
IS -> EB : publish(StockReservedEvent)
deactivate IS

EB -> NS : consume(OrderCreatedEvent)
activate NS
NS -> NS : sendOrderConfirmationEmail(user)
deactivate NS

EB -> OS : consume(PaymentProcessedEvent)
activate OS
OS -> OS : finalizeOrder(paymentConfirmation)
OS -> EB : publish(OrderConfirmedEvent)
deactivate OS
@enduml
```
*   **Explanation:** This sequence diagram details the order creation flow, including the synchronous call to `PaymentService` and the asynchronous event publishing/consumption via the `Event Bus` by `InventoryService` and `NotificationService`.

## 6. Detailed Technology Stack

*   **Backend:**
    *   Language: Python 3.10+
    *   Framework: FastAPI (for REST microservices)
    *   Database: PostgreSQL (for `OrderService`, `ProductService`, `PaymentService`)
    *   Event Bus: Apache Kafka
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: React.js
    *   Language: TypeScript
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Orchestration: Kubernetes
    *   Service Mesh: Istio
    *   Cloud Provider: AWS (EKS, RDS, MSK)

## 7. Detailed Strategies for Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability:** All business services will be stateless and deployed in multiple instances behind a load balancer. Session data will be stored in a clustered Redis. Use of Kubernetes for horizontal auto-scaling.
*   **Security:** Authentication via OpenID Connect. All exposed APIs will be protected by JWT tokens validated by an API Gateway. Sensitive data in the database will be encrypted at rest using AES-256 via native DBMS capabilities.
*   **Performance:** Caching of frequently accessed data (popular products) via Redis. Asynchronous processing of non-critical operations (email sending, notifications) via the event bus.

## 8. Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Logging:** All services will produce structured JSON logs conforming to a defined schema, and send them to a centralized ELK stack via Filebeat. Each log must contain a unique correlation ID for distributed request tracing.
*   **Monitoring:** Exposure of Prometheus metrics by each service. Use of Grafana for dashboard visualization.
*   **Configuration:** Centralized configuration management via Kubernetes ConfigMap per environment.

## 9. Architectural Principles and Conventions

*   All inter-service communication must occur via OpenAPI-documented REST APIs or via the event bus.
*   No business logic should reside in the presentation layer (frontend).
*   Coupling between modules must be minimized via abstract interfaces.
*   Services must be autonomous and own their databases (Database per Service).
