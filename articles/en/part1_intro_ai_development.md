### AI, False Promise or True Lever?

If you're a developer, you're familiar with that unique blend of creative excitement and analytical rigor that drives every project.
Our daily life is a constant dance with complexity: transforming an idea, sometimes just an intuition, into software that works, serves its users, and stands the test of time.
We are builders of the digital world, but we face constant challenges: evolving client demands, technologies renewing at breakneck speed, and the constant pressure to deliver faster, better, and with fewer resources.
At the heart of these challenges, there is often an insidious enemy: the lack of initial clarity, specifications that resemble riddles, and the difficulty, even for the most experienced, of anticipating all the intricacies of a system before starting to build it.

It is in this context that generative Artificial Intelligence made its entrance, like a meteor in the development sky.
Suddenly, the promise of an all-powerful assistant, capable of understanding our needs, generating code, and analyzing complex problems, seemed within reach.
A dream for many of us! But this dream, for some, quickly took on the appearance of a mirage, giving way to frustration.
So, AI in development, false promise or true lever for transformation?

This series of articles is my answer, forged by experience: **AI is an extraordinary lever**, provided we radically change how we **approach** it and **collaborate** with it.

### The Initial Dream

The arrival of Large Language Models (**LLM**) – these **AI brains** capable of dialogue and creation – was met with almost universal euphoria.
The demonstrations were, and still are, spectacular.
Who hasn't been amazed by a functional block of code generated in a few seconds from a simple sentence?

#### Expecting an Intuitive Super-Intelligence

Naturally, our expectations soared.
Many projected onto AI the qualities of an ideal human colleague, but in an **augmented** version: a kind of super-senior developer, endowed with encyclopedic knowledge, infinite work capacity, and above all, an intuition capable of deciphering our fuzziest thoughts.
We imagined that vaguely describing our project would be enough for it to grasp all the stakes, anticipate unstated needs, make the right technical and functional choices, and deliver a turnkey application, ready for use, the Holy Grail of **say it, it's done**.

#### It's Doing Nonsense!

The confrontation with reality was often a cold shower.
When asking an AI to **create a project management application** or **develop an online store** without providing a meticulously precise plan, the initial results can be disconcerting, even chaotic:

*   **Off-target features:** AI, to fill the gaps in our instructions, will draw from its immense training database.
    It will **invent** features that seem statistically probable for this type of application, but which may have nothing to do with our specific needs.
    It may forget others that we considered essential but had not explicitly stated.
*   **Arbitrary technical choices:** Which language? Which framework? What architecture? Which database?
    Lacking directives, AI makes choices, but not necessarily the most relevant ones for our context, our skills, or our performance and budget constraints.
*   **Approximate business logic:** The heart of an application often lies in subtle and specific business rules.
    AI, without an exhaustive description of these rules, can only guess them, often erroneously.
*   **A drift that amplifies:** The more complex the project and the less precise the initial instructions, the more likely AI is to stray from the target, with each new code generation building upon previous approximations.

#### The Trap of Endless Refinement

This is often where the shoe pinches most painfully.
Getting a first draft of code, even imperfect, can seem quick.
But then trying to **correct** it, to **bend** it to our exact wishes, to make it integrate our nuances, becomes an exhausting struggle:

*   **The dialogue of the deaf:** We explain, re-explain, rephrase, but the AI seems not to **understand** what we expect from it.
    It may apply a correction too literally, ignoring the global context, or conversely, modify things that should not have been touched.
*   **The one step forward, two steps back effect:** In trying to correct a bug or add a detail, AI can introduce new ones, sometimes more insidious.
    We find ourselves playing **whack-a-mole** with errors, with each **fix** introducing a new regression.
*   **Loss of control and the black box:** If AI generates large amounts of code that we do not truly control, we end up with an application whose internal functioning we no longer really understand, **maintenance** becomes a nightmare.

Faced with this cycle of frustrations, the temptation is strong to throw in the towel and conclude that AI, in its current state, is just a gadget for trivial tasks, far from being able to assist us on large-scale projects.

### My On-the-Ground Experience

Allow me to share my own journey, as it illuminates the genesis of the methodology I am proposing.

As a developer passionate about efficiency and innovation, generative AI immediately fascinated me.
With my experience in systems modeling and software architecture, I, like many, was seduced by the idea of creating AI agents capable of great autonomy, partners who could take on a significant part of the development burden.

The first experiments were exhilarating.
For well-defined tasks, with a precise context, AI deployed impressive power and speed.
But the transition to more complex projects, from the initial idea to complete realization, quickly highlighted the limits of this **autonomist** approach.
I experienced these moments of **drift**, these cascading corrections where AI seemed to undo with one hand what it had built with the other.

I felt this frustration of seeing initially promising code turn into an unmanageable maze, AI struggling to maintain an overall vision, to integrate my feedback constructively, or simply to **remember** the decisions we had made just a few exchanges earlier.

The conclusion became clear: **solicited as an autonomous but insufficiently informed executor**, AI was not the **hoped-for ally**.
It became a source of complexity and slowdown.
It was not its potential that was in question, but my way of seeking to exploit it.

### The Core Problem

This introspection led me to a deeper understanding of the **why** of these failures.
The fundamental problem does not lie in a supposed **stupidity** of AI, but in a misunderstanding of its nature and its optimal mode of operation.

#### How Does an LLM Think?

LLMs like **Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, do not **think** or **understand** in the human sense.
They are statistical models of incredible sophistication, trained on billions of words and lines of code.
Their apparent **magic** rests on a prodigious ability to **predict** the most probable continuation of a sequence of text (or code) based on the input sequence (your **prompt** and the conversation context).

The richer, more **precise**, non-**ambiguous**, and **aligned** with the type of output you expect the context you provide, the more **relevant** and **useful** its **prediction** (**response**) will be.
Asking it to act with discernment in a contextual vacuum is like asking a **GPS** to guide you without giving it your destination or starting point.

#### The Miscasting Error

The fundamental error many of us initially made was implicitly wanting to delegate the burden of **strategic thinking and detailed planning** to AI.
We hoped that it would analyze our diffuse needs, that it would define hidden objectives, that it would design the optimal architecture, that it would anticipate risks, and that it would plan all the steps.
However, it is precisely this foundational work, demanding and highly contextual, that **creates** the environment in which AI can then excel as an execution assistance tool.

### New Perspective

From this diagnosis was born a conviction, which is the heart of the methodology that this series of articles will unveil: if **AI** desperately needs explicit context to be performant, and if the creation of this context is precisely one of the most arduous and crucial tasks of software development (planning and specification), then **why not use AI itself as an active partner to help us build this context with unprecedented rigor and exhaustiveness?**

Instead of suffering it in the coding phase due to lack of preparation, we will **mobilize it upstream, from the first glimmerings of a project**.
We will transform it into an expert interlocutor, a tireless analyst, a consulting architect, a critical UI/UX designer, a methodical data modeler.
We will dialogue with it, question it, let it question us, to co-build, step by step, a set of **blueprints** – specifications, architecture, design, data schema – of such clarity and depth that they will become the **fuel** for an AI-assisted implementation phase that will be, this time, truly **synergistic**, **efficient**, and **productive** of value.

It is no longer about **taming** a wild and unpredictable beast, but about **intelligently collaborating** with a powerful tool whose language and needs we've learned to understand.
This is the promise of a new era for the developer: that of **augmented development**, where our human intelligence is multiplied by a well-directed artificial partner.
